<h3>FAQs - Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><li>In the recent app update, where is the specific number selection?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> The specific number feature is now in the settings menu (gear icon).  You can set which numbers you want to practice by setting the Min/Max ranges for the First and Second numbers.  You can set a different range for each operator.  Previously you could only select the specific number for the second number and it wouldn't save your selections.
