<h3>FAQs - Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><li>How do I get to the next question/card?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Once you have answered the question correctly, please swipe up to get to the next card.  In flash card mode, you can swipe up to mark the card correct, and swipe down to mark the card incorrect.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><li>Is it possible to just show the answer, not multiple choice?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Yes, there is an "In App Purchase" called Flash Card Mode which enables you to just display the answer.  You can select this feature in the settings screen, under Card Mode.
If you purchased the Full Paid School Version, this feature is included.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><li>How do I get to the mixed operations screen?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Please tap the arrow icon located at the top of the main screen.  Alternatively you can swipe left/right to flip the card.  
The Full Paid School Version or the "In App Purchase" is required to use this feature.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><li>What's the difference between the Free Version and Full Paid School Version?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The Full Paid School Version has all the available features unlocked.  The Free Version has "In App Purchases" where you can buy one feature at a time or all.  If you purchase 
all the "In App Purchases", it will be exactly the same as the Full Paid School Version.  Many school districts do not allow apps with "In App Purchases".  If you plan on purchasing all the "In App Purchase" features, we recommend you buy
the "Full Paid School Version" as it is easier to Family Share. </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><li>How can I create my own specific questions?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> To access the "Custom Cards" feature, just swipe left/right on the main screen and then select "Custom Cards". Enter your desired question and tap the "Add Question" button.  Once you are done adding questions, swipe left/right to see all the questions you have added.  Tap the "Start" button to begin.  An "In App Purchase" or the "Full Paid School Version" is required to used this feature.</p>
